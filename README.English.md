# Introduction

FGTK - Fat GC-MS ToolKit is an application developed with shiny and a series of R packages, which is mainly used to solve the problem of data analysis of Agilent GC-MS with older instruments (e.g. Agilent 6890N and Agilent 5975C). The newer Agilent instruments can use MassHunter to process a batch of data, but the older instruments can only use MSD Chemstation to do some simple pre-processing of the data, and FGTK can integrate and downstream analysis based on the results exported from MSD Chemstation.  
This application was developed by the Key Laboratory of Sustainable Forest Ecosystem Management, Ministry of Education, College of Forestry, Northeast Forestry University.  
The gui is extremely simple and the parameter settings may need to be redesigned, so please forgive me.
